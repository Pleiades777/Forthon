This contains an example which shows the use of Forthon in cases where the
fortran90 modules already exist and fortran derived types are being used. If
no derived types are being used, the original fortran should be able to be
used without change.

List of files:
  example2.F:      Main fortran file which includes changes that are needed to
                   work with derived types.
  example2_orig.F: Original version of the main fortran file before any
                   changes were made.
  example2.py:     Test python script
  example2.v:      Interface description file
  Makefile:        Builds and test this example
  README:          This file
