Forthon generates links between Fortran(90 and 95) and Python. Python is a
high level, object oriented, interactive and scripting language that allows a
flexible and versatile interface to computational tools. The Forthon package
generates the necessary wrapping code which allows access to the Fortran
database and to the Fortran subroutines and functions.  This provides a
development package where the computationally intensive parts of a code can
be written in efficient Fortran, and the high level controlling code can be
written in the much more versatile Python language.


Release Notes:

0.7.12: August 29, 2008

 - Added the __version__ attribute
 - In Forthon_builder, added a fix to handle a problem with older versions of
   numpy. numpy would monkey path some of distutils routines and these would
   get imported when get_include was called. So, for older versions of numpy,
   the code from get_include is included explicitly rather than calling it
   from numpy. This only affects numpy versions older than 1.1.0.
 - Fixed ForthonPackage_staticarrays for multi-dimensional strings
